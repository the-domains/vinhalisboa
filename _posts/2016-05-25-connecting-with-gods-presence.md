We summarise this as Extending God’s Kingdom together, everywhere in every way. </p></article>

We are a growing movement of churches, built on God's transforming word, who worship God with passion, intimacy and expectation.

We are God's children, empowered by his Spirit, extending His kingdom together, everywhere in every way.

We will serve people, especially the poor and vulnerable, and communicate the goodness of Jesus with compassion and generosity.

We will make disciples, develop leaders, plant churches, and contribute to the blessing of the whole Body of Christ.
